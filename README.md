Software License TextMate Bundle
================================
TextMate Bundle for adding popular open source licenses and Doxygen compatible (JavaDoc format) header/license comment blocks to your software code.  I've included the licenses I use most -- GPL3, Affero GPL3, Apache 2.0, and MIT -- in the initial bundle.  For each, there is a full license that can be used to create a license page in your project.  There is also a License Block version to add as a header to each source code file.


Usage
-----
Clone this repo to your TextMate Bundles directory.  On the Mac this is located, or should be created, in a TextMate Bundles directory under your user's application support library:

> cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/

Once in the correct directory, run the following command:

> git clone git@github.com:toddsampson/SoftwareLicense.git

Finally, open TextMate and select:

> Bundles -> Bundle Editor -> Reload Bundles

This will add SoftwareLicense to your Bundles menu.  When a license or license block is selected from this menu, it will insert at the current cursor location.


Updates
-------
If you would like any additional licenses added to this bundle or notice any issues, feel free to add the request as an issue in Github or fork the repo to update yourself.  If you do fork, while I have only used an Apache 2.0 license on this bundle, I would appreciate if you sent me a pull request so I can keep this repo up-to-date for all of the other users.
